Event 1: Major Argument (Opposing Alignments)

Can happen with people you dislike (or one day you can start it yourself)

Will have the following effects: You will argue, you lose relationship points with them. You will also lose relationship points with their friends. However you will gain a boost with their enemies. If done at school, the teachers will get involved, and will dislike the perpetrator.

Event 2: Meet a mate at the football

More likely to happen between you and characters with high strength/athleticism. Boosts relationship with them. You can also go to the football with them later on for further increase.

Event 3: One-upmanship

If you have a high skill, this will happen between you and someone else. This can create some sort of rivalry that decreases relationship, unless you try to fix the rivalry. You can make a strong friendship.

Event 4: Do evil stuff (Chaotic Evil)

Commit petty crimes with a mate. There will be consequences if caught (justice?) but relationship increased a lot.

ALSO, can we please add Alignments somehow? The system would be handy for working out who events can happen to.
